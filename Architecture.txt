Architecture Overview
---------------------

This system uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture where each node communicates with others using WebSockets (ws://). Each node listens on a unique port (e.g., 6001, 6002, 6003).

Master Peer Role
----------------
- The master peer acts as a directory service for the network.
- It maintains a list of all active nodes and their WebSocket addresses.
- When a new node wants to join the network, it first connects to the master peer to retrieve the list of existing nodes.
- After obtaining the list, the new node establishes direct P2P WebSocket connections with other nodes.
- This approach allows dynamic discovery and connection of peers, supporting network scalability and resilience.

Node Communication
------------------
- Nodes communicate directly with each other using P2P WebSocket connections.
- Each node can broadcast messages or data to its peers.
- If a node disconnects, the master peer updates the node list and notifies other nodes as needed.

This architecture enables decentralized communication while using the master peer for efficient node discovery and management.
